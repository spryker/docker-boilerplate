# Installing Docker prerequisites on MacOS

This article describes Docker installation prerequisites for MacOS.


## Minimum system requirements

Review the minimum system requirements in the table:

| System Requirement | Additional Details |
| --- | --- |
| vCPU: 2 | This is a minimum requirement. The value can be higher than 2. A lower value is not sufficient for running the application. |
| RAM: 4GB | This is a minimum requirement. The value can be higher than 4GB. A lower value is not sufficient for installation purposes. |
| Swap: 2GB | This is a minimum requirement. The value can be higher than 2GB. A lower value is not sufficient for installation purposes. |

## Install and configure a Docker manager

You can run Spryker in Docker using Docker Desktop or OrbStack. Docker Desktop is a free default tool, but OrbStack works faster with intel-based Macs. 


### Install Docker Desktop

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop (Mac)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/).

{% info_block infoBox %}

Signup for Docker Hub is not required.

{% endinfo_block %}

2. Accept the privilege escalation request "Docker Desktop needs privileged access.".

3. In the Docker Desktop, go to preferences by selecting the gear in the top right corner.

4. In the **General** section of **Preferences**, click the **Use Docker Compose V2** checkbox.

5. Set recommended memory and swap limits:

    1. Go to **Resources** > **ADVANCED**.
    2. Set **CPUs:** to "4" or higher.
    3. Set **Memory:** to "4.00 GB" or higher.
    4. Set **Swap:** to "2.00 GB" or higher.
    5. Set the desired **Disk image size:**.
    6. Select the desired **Disk image location**.
    7. Select **Apply & Restart**.

### Install OrbStack

Download and install [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/download).


To migrate from Docker Desktop to OrbStack, see [Migrate from Docker to OrbStack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install#docker-migration).
To run Docker Desktop and OrbStack side-by-side and switch between them, see [Side-by-side
](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install#docker-context).

## Install Mutagen for development mode

If you are going to run Spryker in [development mode](../02-installation-guides/01-choosing-an-installation-mode.md#development-mode), install or update Mutagen and Mutagen Compose to the latest version:

```bash
brew list | grep mutagen | xargs brew remove && brew install mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen-compose && mutagen daemon stop && mutagen daemon start
```
